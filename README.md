**Mulberry** is a mobile party game framework in the vein of the Jackbox Party Pack.

This is an ongoing project and is still early in development. Other open source hackers are invited to contribute! Please feel free to add to the waffle board!

## Deployment
To run locally, clone the package off github and run `npm install` or `yarn`. You can also add it directly to an existing npm project.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/mulberry.

Additionally, you may want to clone the [server](https://github.com/dane-johnson/mulberry-server.git) and [client](https://github.com/dane-johnson/mulberry-client.git) packages independently. This will allow you to `yarn link` them to the server and work with a development version of all three components of the project.
